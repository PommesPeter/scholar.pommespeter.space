I am now a MS student in [CFM](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn) Lab at University of Eletronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by Prof. Lianli Gao and Prof. Jingkuan Song.

I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from Guilin Univerity of Electronic Technology from 2019 to 2023.

I'm currently interested in in Multi-modal Learning and AI Complier, especially focusing on how to make good use of different modal for understanding the real world. I think I am still a newbie and hope to meet more people to learn and discuss together. Welcome to read my [blog](https://memo.sylin.host) and add friend links to each other.
